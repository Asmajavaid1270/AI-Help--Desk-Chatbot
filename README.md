# AI Help  Desk Chatbot
Mini Chatbot
This Python program is an AI Help Desk Chatbot that combines all previous tasks into one interactive system. It detects user intent (like greeting, study, food, or thanks) using keyword rules and provides smart automated replies. The chatbot also uses the activity recommender for helpful study tips and logs the full conversation history for review at the end.
